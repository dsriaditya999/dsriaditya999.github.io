abstract: This project leverages voice recognition technology to enable precise and intuitive control over a robot's movements. Developed using an Arduino UNO, HC05 Bluetooth module, and L298N Motor Driver, the robot receives voice commands via a mobile phone application, translating spoken instructions into actions such as moving forward, backward, left, or right. The robot's design includes essential components like wheels, a chassis, DC motors, and an LM393 Speed Sensor, all integrated to ensure accurate movement and stability. The voice commands are processed and transmitted from the smartphone to the robot through the Bluetooth module, enabling seamless communication and control. This project showcases the potential of combining natural language processing with robotics, providing a user-friendly interface for operating robotic systems and demonstrating the practical applications of voice-controlled technology in enhancing human-robot interaction. The project's implementation not only highlights technical proficiency in robotics and programming but also emphasizes the innovative use of voice control to simplify and enhance the user experience.
