I am a Scientist in the Mission Simulation Group (MSG) at [U.R. Rao Satellite Centre, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)](https://www.ursc.gov.in). I am actively involved in contributing to several flagship ISRO endeavours namely [SPADEX](https://www.isro.gov.in/spadex_docking.html) Cooperative Docking Mission, Non-Cooperative Docking Mission, All-Electric Propulsion Mission, [Human Spaceflight Mission](https://www.isro.gov.in/Gaganyaan.html), and the Mars Landing Mission. My work involves tackling diverse AI and robotics research challenges in aerospace systems. I am also engaged in notable technology demonstration projects, including pose estimation and tracking of uncooperative spacecraft using monocular images & point-cloud data, and autonomous navigation & mobile manipulation for rovers.

Before joining ISRO, I graduated from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu) with a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering, having earned the prestigious and fully funded Dr. Satish Dhawan Fellowship from the Department of Space, Government of India. At Caltech, I conducted research to develop efficacious multimodal deep sensor fusion methods for object detection in the [Autonomous Robotics and Control Lab (ARCL)](http://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu) led by Prof. [Soon-Jo Chung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-ClLU3EAAAAJ&hl=en). Following my time at Caltech, I had the opportunity to intern at the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov) in the Optical Communication Systems group. There, I collaborated with Dr. Sabino Piazzolla and spearheaded the development of short-term forecasting techniques to predict key atmospheric parameters helpful in characterizing the optical channel.

In a more general sense, I am interested in Machine Learning, Robotics and Computer Vision. I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of these fields and their applications in aerospace systems. I am always on the lookout for exciting research opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you have any ideas or projects in mind.
