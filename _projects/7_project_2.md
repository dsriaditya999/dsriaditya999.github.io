Advancement of technology in various fields like Signal Processing and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) semiconductor technology has led to significant improvements in the automobile industry. Recently, a lot of path-breaking research done for enhancing the performance of Autonomous Vehicles, has given a colossal boost to Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this context, automotive radar has emerged as a low-cost system that provides robust performance in inclement environmental conditions, such as heavy precipitation, pollution, or bad illumination.

Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of industries and applications, including Self-Driving Cars. The reasons for their popularity are because of their accurate short-range measurements, low sensitivity to clutter, low cost, robustness and easy integration. The FMCW Radar Module, Ikshana, proposed in this abstract, is planned to be developed using the Vajra(C64-A100, Shakti C-class) SoC developed by IIT Madras. Ikshana is a low cost solution, which can be utilized for developing many useful indigenous products, including autonomous vehicles, Night-Vision goggles (for soldiers) etc. (See Section V).

The prospected module will be implemented on Xilinx Arty A7 FPGA using BSV. It is also planned to add some soft-core extensions1 to the Swadeshi processor, like the FFT Block and CSI Block, as the performance and speed are crucial for this module.


Submitted Proposal as a part of the Swadeshi Microprocessor Challenge being conducted by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Govt. of India) to promote the use of indigenous microprocessors in innovative solutions.
