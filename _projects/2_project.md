This project aims to develop a real mobile robot (Raspberry Pi based) with advanced capabilities, including initial global localization using Monte Carlo Localization, smooth car-like driving, and efficient path planning through narrow and complex areas. The robot can detect and avoid new obstacles, dynamically update an "Obstacle Map," and replan its path. Utilizing RRT-based motion planners for non-holonomic robots, the project focuses on two-wheeled systems like cars and car-trailer combinations. These planners generate raw paths refined through post-processing for smooth, collision-free navigation. Experiments and analyses show the non-holonomic RRT algorithm's effectiveness, which can ehnace autonomous navigation in challenging environments for applications such as smart cars and planetary rovers.
