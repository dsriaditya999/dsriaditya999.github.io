abstract: Technological advancements in Signal Processing and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) semiconductor technology have significantly impacted the automobile industry, particularly in enhancing Autonomous Vehicles and Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Automotive radar, particularly Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars, has become a popular choice for robust and cost-effective performance in challenging environmental conditions. The proposed Ikshana FMCW Radar Module, utilizing the Vajra (C64-A100, Shakti C-class) SoC from IIT Madras, aims to provide a low-cost, indigenous solution for applications such as autonomous vehicles and night-vision goggles. Implemented on a Xilinx Arty A7 FPGA with planned soft-core extensions, this module represents an innovative approach to leveraging indigenous microprocessors, as highlighted in the Swadeshi Microprocessor Challenge by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.

Advancement of technology in various fields like Signal Processing and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) semiconductor technology has led to significant improvements in the automobile industry. Recently, a lot of path-breaking research done for enhancing the performance of Autonomous Vehicles, has given a colossal boost to Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this context, automotive radar has emerged as a low-cost system that provides robust performance in inclement environmental conditions, such as heavy precipitation, pollution, or bad illumination.

Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of industries and applications, including Self-Driving Cars. The reasons for their popularity are because of their accurate short-range measurements, low sensitivity to clutter, low cost, robustness and easy integration. The FMCW Radar Module, Ikshana, proposed in this abstract, is planned to be developed using the Vajra(C64-A100, Shakti C-class) SoC developed by IIT Madras. Ikshana is a low cost solution, which can be utilized for developing many useful indigenous products, including autonomous vehicles, Night-Vision goggles (for soldiers) etc. (See Section V).

The prospected module will be implemented on Xilinx Arty A7 FPGA using BSV. It is also planned to add some soft-core extensions1 to the Swadeshi processor, like the FFT Block and CSI Block, as the performance and speed are crucial for this module.


Submitted Proposal as a part of the Swadeshi Microprocessor Challenge being conducted by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Govt. of India) to promote the use of indigenous microprocessors in innovative solutions.
