The project focuses on developing motion planning methods for non-holonomic mobile robots, specifically wheeled systems like cars, using Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) based algorithms. The objective was to create a planner capable of efficiently and effectively navigating through complex environments, avoiding obstacles in challenging scenarios such as narrow garages, parallel parking, and tight streets. Through a series of experiments, we tested the planner's performance and derived insightful inferences from our analyses, supported by compelling graphical results and visual stills.
