This project aims to develop effective methods for a robotic snake arm to perform complex tasks such as obstacle avoidance, targeting and touching a random object (e.g., a colored cube) with precise gripper orientation, and untangling itself from knots. We considered a simulated environment in ROS2, where obstacles like rocks fall vertically, presenting dynamic challenges for the robotic arm. Through various experiments and extensive analysis across different robots and experimental scenarios, we sought to optimize the performance and versatility of the robotic snake arm in real-world applications.
