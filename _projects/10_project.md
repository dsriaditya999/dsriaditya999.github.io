This project exemplifies the transformative potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) by enabling voice-controlled automation of household lighting through Google Assistant. It utilizes an Arduino UNO, ESP8266 WiFi module, and a dual-channel relay to create an auxiliary circuit that can control a standard light bulb with voice commands. By integrating the system with ThingSpeak for data management and IFTTT for seamless interaction between Google Assistant and the IoT devices, users can effortlessly turn the light on or off by simply saying "OK Google, Lights ON" or "OK Google, Lights OFF." The project demonstrates the practical application of IoT in enhancing home automation, emphasizing ease of use, convenience, and the power of modern technology to simplify daily tasks. This innovative solution not only highlights the capabilities of IoT but also provides a glimpse into the future of smart homes, where everyday actions can be managed through intuitive voice commands.
